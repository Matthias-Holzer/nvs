# Directory Services
## Kerberos
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qW361k3-BtU

* Symetric Keys based on Passwords
* KDC Key Distribution Center (performend by the Domanin Controller)
* Auhtentication Server (s)
  * checks if user data is ledigt
* Ticket Granting Server (t)
  * hands out tickets for users to communicate with printers, file server, etc

### Process
![p1](p1.png)
A sends a Message to the Keyserver, that it is the PC A, that it whants to speek to the ticket server and a random number(not relevant). A has a offline excanged symetric key for authentification.

![p2](p2.png)
* KaT Session Key between A and T (generatet by S)
* na a random number to prevent replay attacs
* T currecnt time
* L livetime of the ticket
* TGS your ok to talk to the ticket granting server
* KaS the hole message is encryted by the Key between K and S

![p3](p3.png)
Ticket Granting Ticket.

Because T does not have the KaT Key S randomly generatet, S also sends it encryted with SaT key to A. A sends it then to T.

## LDAP
Basically the same as Kerberos but from Microsoft
Active Directory uses Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), which is Microsofts version of Kerberos and DNS.
